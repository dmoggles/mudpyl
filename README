What pymudclient is
===================

pymudclient is a pure Python implementation of a MUD client. The aim is to keep the
core concepts simple, and give the user the ability to fiddle around with it
to suit their needs. Therefore, the core of the client is fairly small and
modular, with simple interfaces between the parts.

pymudclient is a fork of mudpyl.  See details in "Author, copyright and license"
