Meta
 - Update README with appropriate ownership/license/etc information
 
Core 
 - GMCP support
 - State support in realms
 - Implement multiple output channel (for things like separate windows with filtered output)
 - Implement proxy mode (pymudclient forwards output to another telnet connection and accepts input from telnet connection, 
   rather than the gui)
 - MXP support (this is very low priority)
 
Engine
 - Multiline triggers
 - Timers
 - Chained triggers

 
GUI
 - get copy and paste outside the application working
 - Add support for more flexible UI implementation - possibly using Glade. This requires separating UI from data a little bit more
   and creating an actual middle layer GUI API
 - Make style customizable (font is too small right now, etc)

Testing
 - Sort out the existing state of testing, figure out what they do, how to improve
